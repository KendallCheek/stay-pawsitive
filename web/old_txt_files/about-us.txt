“Stay Pawsitive” is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
We are a group of passionate animal loving volunteers who strongly desire to be the hands and voices of those who cannot speak for themselves in times of disaster. We believe that our lives are enriched by the services and resources we provide to animal rescue and disaster relief groups. Our partnership with these organizations throughout the United States helps save lives.

At “Stay Pawsitive” our main objective is to support animals affected by disaster events. As a non-profit organization, all proceeds raised through our online store support local and national level animal rescue organizations. Our products are made locally using ethically sourced materials and are always plant based to decrease our environmental footprint. We also ensure that everything in our store is tested and pet friendly with no artificial dyes or perfumes.

All of our products, from our "Stay Pawsitive" brand Grain-Free Dog Food to our Natural Defense Herbal Flea Shampoo are also donated toward disaster relief efforts such as The Humane Society and Best Friends Save Them All to provide the best care for our animal friends out in the world that need our help.
