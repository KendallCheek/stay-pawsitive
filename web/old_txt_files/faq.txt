Are your products really safe for my pet?
- All of our products are certified to be safe for your pets by the Center for Pet Safety, or CPS. Each product is not only "crash tested" but is also free of anything that may be harmful to you, your pets, or the environment.

What should I do if I haven't received my order?
﻿- All orders come with a tracking number so you can see where your order is on its route to you. If the tracking number lists the order as "Delivered" but you have not received it, contact support at support@staypawsitive.org so we can resolve the issue.

Can I cancel my order?
- You may request an order cancellation by contacting support@staypawsitive.org with your order number. Please be aware that we cannot cancel an order once it has been shipped, so you may need to request a return or exchange instead.

Do you have a return policy?
- Return any product for any reason within 60 days of receipt for a refund equal to the amount paid for the product (not including shipping charges). The refund will be issued back to the original method of payment.
