                        <em><strong>Stay Pawsitive</strong></em> is a non-profit 
                        501(c)(3) organization  based in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
                        We are a group of passionate animal loving volunteers who 
                        strongly desire to be the hands and voices of those who 
                        cannot speak for themselves in times of disaster. We believe 
                        that our lives are enriched by the services and resources we 
                        provide to animal rescue and disaster relief groups. Our partnership 
                        with these organizations throughout the United States helps save lives.

                        At <em><strong>Stay Pawsitive</strong></em> our main objective 
                        is to support animals affected by disaster events. As a non-profit 
                        organization, all proceeds raised through our online store support 
                        local and national level animal rescue organizations. Our products 
                        are made locally using ethically sourced materials and are always 
                        plant based to decrease our environmental footprint. We also ensure 
                        that everything in our store is tested and pet friendly with no 
                        artificial dyes or perfumes.

                        All of our products, from our <em><strong>Stay Pawsitive</strong></em> brand Grain-Free 
                        Dog Food to our Natural Defense Herbal Flea Shampoo are also 
                        donated toward disaster relief efforts such as The Humane Society 
                        and Best Friends Save Them All to provide the best care for our 
                        animal friends out in the world that need our help.
